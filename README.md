# MEA-KY3-Robotics
This is a term project for an undergraduate Robotics course at University of Patras, Greece.
# Overview
In this project:
- An industrial 6 Degree of Freedom robot is chosen: KUKA KR 6 R700 sixx WP.
- The Denavit-Hartenberg parameters of the robot are calculated.
- Forward kinematics code is implemented.
- Inverse kinematics code is implemented.
- Jacobian is calculated.
- Linear and Quadratic Interpolation for two points in space is implemented as an application of the implemented code.

The quadratic time interval is equal to the time required for each joint to reach half of its maximum nominal velocity, with an acceleration equal to Ï€/2 rad/sec^2.
